### Version 3.0 (December 4, 2017)

Many thanks to [Michael Musenbrock](https://github.com/redeamer) for
doing most of the heavy lifting on this release.

-   Added support for Android Emulator 2.0
    ([JENKINS-40178](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-40178),
    [JENKINS-43215](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-43215),
    [JENKINS-44490](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-44490))

    -   The QEMU2 engine will be used automatically, and should be
        faster and more stable

    -   Older SDK Tools will be automatically upgraded to a modern
        version as appropriate

    -   Fixed creation of non-default ABI images with SDK Tools \< 25.3
        ([JENKINS-32737](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-32737))

    -   Thanks to Michael Musenbrock

-   Updated minimum Jenkins version to 2.32

### Version 2.15 (May 23, 2016)

-   Ensure that newer emulators aren't left running when a build
    completes
    ([JENKINS-35004](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-35004))
    -   This is required as SDK Tools 25.1.6 introduced a breaking
        change to the emulator console interface

### Version 2.14.1 (April 20, 2016)

-   Fix crash when using named emulators
    ([JENKINS-34152](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-34152))

-   Fixed severe reliability issues when multiple emulators were running
    at the same time
-   Improved emulator startup detection to be more reliable
    -   Thanks to Andy Piper
-   Prevented emulators from using the new QEMU2 engine, which is
    missing required features (e.g. Android bugs
    [\#202762](http://b.android.com/202762),
    [\#202853](http://b.android.com/202853),
    [\#205202](http://b.android.com/205202),
    [\#205204](http://b.android.com/205204),
    [\#205272](http://b.android.com/205272))

    ([JENKINS-27702](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-27702))
    -   Thanks to Mads Kal√∏r

### Version 2.13 (March 12, 2015)

-   Reverted to the "localhost:XXXX" style of connecting to emulators,
    as using "emulator-XXXX" seemed to be a very common cause of
    emulator startup failures
    ([JENKINS-11952](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-11952))
-   Fixed inability to launch Android tools on Unix slaves from a
    Windows master due to a bad path separator
    ([JENKINS-23134](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-23134))
    -   Thanks to Dave Brown
-   Fixed the naming of emulators using x86-based Google APIs as Google
    changed the naming scheme again
    ([JENKINS-23252](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-23252))
-   Fixed the naming of emulators due to a change in the ABI naming

    -   Thanks to Chiara Chiappini
-   Fixed the inability to start an emulator in certain cases on 64-bit
    Mac OS X machines with SDK tools version 23.0.4 or newer
    ([JENKINS-26893](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-26893))
-   Switched to using "init.svc.bootanim" to more reliably detect boot
    completion, where appropriate
    ([JENKINS-22555](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-22555))
-   Removed reliance on the `aapt` tool and the unreliable detection
    code surrounding it
-   APK install/uninstall build steps now wait for the system package
    manager to be available before trying to do anything
-   Added timeouts to APK install/uninstall build steps as it's not
    uncommon that `adb` hangs during installation (e.g. [Android bug
    \#10255](http://b.android.com/10255))
-   Added timeouts to `adb` when attempting to unlock the screen after
    boot
-   Increased minimum Jenkins requirement to 1.565.1 to get a crash fix
    important for Java 8 users

-   Added option to pass extra command line parameters to the monkey
    tool
    ([JENKINS-13559](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-13559))
-   The SDK tools and platform tools directories of the SDK in use are
    now prepended to `$PATH` during a build
    -   This means you no longer need to specify the full path to `adb`
        in an "Execute shell" build step, for example
-   When auto-installing the Android SDK, version 24.0.2 is now used
-   Added support for Android 5.1

### Version 2.12 (October 21, 2014)

-   Added support for Android 5.0, 64-bit system images, and xxxhdpi
    screen density

    ([JENKINS-23252](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-23252))
    -   Thanks to Thomas Keller
-   Wait for ADB server to start before starting the emulator
    ([JENKINS-11952](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-11952))
    -   Should help with cases where the emulator starts faster than the
        ADB server
    -   Thanks to Richard Mortimer

-   Fixed problem connecting to ADB with non four-digit port numbers
    ([JENKINS-12821](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-12821),
    [JENKINS-20819](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-20819))
    -   This should enable connecting to emulators from the
        android-maven-plugin
    -   Thanks to Richard Mortimer
-   Use "emulator" instead of "localhost" when connecting to emulators
    ([JENKINS-12821](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-12821),
    [JENKINS-22334](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-22334))
    -   This should fix strange connection failures or multiple devices
        which started appearing in recent SDK tools versions
    -   Thanks to Richard Mortimer
-   Added support for build-tools so that aapt can be located in newer
    SDKs
    ([JENKINS-18584](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-18584))
    -   Thanks to Steve Moyer

-   Accept multi-line properties when parsing project.properties files
    ([JENKINS-22530](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-22530))
    -   Thanks to xstex
-   Allow adding a suffix to generated AVD names
    ([JENKINS-11083](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-11083))
    -   This makes it possible to use the exact same emulator config in
        two jobs without one job having to block waiting for the other
        job to finish using the emulator.
    -   Thanks to Hasan Hosgel and Payman Delshad
-   Fixed paths to ensure the inline help text should always be properly
    displayed
    ([JENKINS-20303](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-20303))

-   When verifying whether an AVD exists, ensure we check the same
    directory that the `android` tool creates AVDs in
    -   It was possible in some environments (more likely Windows) that
        this was not the case

### Version 1.3 (Jul 18, 2010)

-   Added option to reset emulator to its default state before each
    build
